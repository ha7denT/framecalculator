# Timecoder — Sprint Plans

## Overview

This document breaks down the development of Timecoder into discrete sprints. Each sprint is designed to be completable in roughly 1-2 weeks and results in demonstrable, testable functionality.

**Total Sprints:** 11
**Target MVP (Sprints 1-6):** Core calculator + video player + markers
**Target 1.0 (Sprints 7-11):** Export + polish + responsive layout + Liquid Glass UI

---

## Sprint 1: Project Foundation & Core Models

### Goal
Establish project structure, core data types, and timecode arithmetic engine.

### Deliverables

- [x] Xcode project setup (SwiftUI App, macOS 13.0+ target)
- [x] Project folder structure per architecture spec
- [x] `FrameRate` enum with all supported rates + custom
- [x] `Timecode` struct with:
  - Frame-based internal storage
  - Arithmetic operators (+, -, multiply by scalar)
  - Conversion to/from frame count
  - String parsing (HH:MM:SS:FF format)
  - String formatting (with drop frame semicolon notation)
  - Drop frame calculation logic
- [x] Unit tests for `Timecode` and `FrameRate`

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All frame rates calculate correctly (verify against known timecode values)
- [x] Drop frame skips frames 0,1 at each minute except every 10th minute
- [x] `Timecode("01:00:00:00", .fps24) + Timecode("00:00:01:00", .fps24)` = `01:00:01:00`
- [x] Parsing handles both `:` (non-drop) and `;` (drop frame) separators
- [x] 100% test coverage on Timecode arithmetic

### Notes

This sprint has no UI. Focus entirely on getting the math right — everything else depends on it.

### Implementation Notes (for future reference)

**Project Structure:**
- Using Swift Package Manager (`Package.swift`) for building and testing
- App entry point (`@main`) is in `Timecoder/App/` but excluded from the library target to avoid duplicate symbol errors during testing
- UI folders (`Views/`, `ViewModels/`) also excluded from library target for now

**Drop Frame Algorithm:**
The drop frame implementation uses a "count dropped frames, then add back" approach:
1. Calculate how many frame numbers have been skipped by the current frame count
2. Add those back to get a "display frame number"
3. Convert display frame number to HH:MM:SS:FF using simple NDF math

Key formula for drops within a 10-minute block:
- First minute (0): no drop
- Minutes 1-9: each has a drop of 2 frames
- `framesPerTenMinutes = 1800 * 10 - 2 * 9 = 17982`

**Testing:**
- 51 tests total (9 for FrameRate, 42 for Timecode)
- Round-trip tests verify `components → frames → components` consistency
- Edge cases tested: minute boundaries, 10-minute boundaries, hour mark, negative durations

**Key Files:**
- `Timecoder/Models/FrameRate.swift` — enum with computed properties
- `Timecoder/Models/Timecode.swift` — value type with all arithmetic and parsing
- `TimecoderTests/TimecodeTests.swift` — comprehensive test coverage

**Build Commands:**
```bash
swift build   # Build the library
swift test    # Run all tests
```

## Sprint 2: Standalone Calculator UI

### Goal
Build the calculator-only interface with working timecode operations.

### Deliverables

- [x] `CalculatorViewModel` with operation state management
- [x] `TimecodeDisplayView` — large, selectable timecode field
- [x] `FrameRatePicker` — dropdown or segmented control
- [x] `CalculatorView` — main calculator layout
- [x] Operation mode selector (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Frame↔TC)
- [x] Keyboard input for timecode entry
- [x] Copy/paste support (⌘C, ⌘V) for timecode field
- [x] Basic app window with calculator as default view

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Can enter timecode via keyboard (numeric keys + colons)
- [x] Can switch between all supported frame rates
- [x] Addition: `01:00:00:00 + 00:30:00:00 = 01:30:00:00`
- [x] Subtraction: `01:00:00:00 - 00:00:30:00 = 00:59:30:00`
- [x] Multiplication: `00:00:30:00 × 4 = 00:02:00:00`
- [x] Frame→TC: `86400 frames @ 24fps = 01:00:00:00`
- [x] TC→Frame: `01:00:00:00 @ 24fps = 86400 frames`
- [x] Copy timecode to clipboard, paste from clipboard
- [x] Frame rate change recalculates displayed timecode

### Notes

Keep the window compact (~320×480pt). This is the "calculator app" mode users will use daily.

### Implementation Notes (for future reference)

**Project Structure:**
- Xcode project created (`Timecoder.xcodeproj`) for building and running the app
- SPM (`Package.swift`) retained for running unit tests via `swift test`
- App entry point with dark mode by default and hidden title bar window style

**Key Components:**
- `CalculatorViewModel.swift` — Observable view model managing:
  - Current timecode display
  - Digit-by-digit entry with automatic formatting
  - Pending operations (add, subtract, multiply, frame conversions)
  - Frame rate selection with automatic timecode conversion
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages

- `KeypadView.swift` — Calculator button UI with:
  - Number pad (0-9) with delete button
  - Operation buttons (+, −, ×, =)
  - Mode buttons (F→TC, TC→F, AC, C)
  - Multiplier input field for multiply operations

- `TimecodeDisplayView.swift` — Large SF Mono display:
  - Text selection enabled for copy
  - Frame count display below timecode
  - Visual feedback for pending operations and errors

- `FrameRatePicker.swift` — Compact dropdown menu for frame rate selection

**Keyboard Handling:**
- Uses NSViewRepresentable with NSView.keyDown() for macOS 13.0 compatibility
- Supports numpad and top-row number keys
- Operations: +, -, *, x, =, Enter, Delete, Escape, C

**Build Commands:**
```bash
# Build via Xcode
xcodebuild -project Timecoder.xcodeproj -scheme Timecoder build

# Run tests via SPM
swift test

# Open in Xcode
open Timecoder.xcodeproj
```

**Key Files:**
- `Timecoder/ViewModels/CalculatorViewModel.swift` — Main calculator logic
- `Timecoder/Views/Calculator/CalculatorView.swift` — Main UI composition
- `Timecoder/Views/Calculator/KeypadView.swift` — Button UI
- `Timecoder/Views/Calculator/TimecodeDisplayView.swift` — Display component
- `Timecoder/Views/Calculator/FrameRatePicker.swift` — Frame rate dropdown

**Known Issues (deferred to Sprint 8):**
- Entry validation visual feedback: Invalid timecode components (e.g., seconds > 59) are shown during entry but only validated on commit. Need clearer visual indication that entry is "draft" and may fail. See Sprint 8 notes.

---

## Sprint 3: Video Loading & Metadata

### Goal
Implement drag-and-drop video loading and metadata extraction.

### Deliverables

- [x] `VideoMetadata` model (duration, codec, bitrate, resolution, frame rate, color space, audio channels, file size)
- [x] `VideoLoader` service using AVFoundation
- [x] Drag-and-drop handler on main window
- [x] `MetadataPanel` view displaying extracted info
- [x] Auto-detect frame rate and set calculator accordingly
- [x] `AppState` to track current mode (calculator vs video)
- [x] Basic mode switching (calculator → video inspector)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Drop .mov, .mp4, .m4v files onto window
- [x] Metadata panel shows all 8 metadata fields
- [x] Frame rate auto-populates calculator's frame rate selector
- [x] Unsupported files show appropriate error
- [x] Can return to calculator-only mode (close video)

### Notes

Use `AVAsset.load(_:)` with async/await for metadata extraction. Handle files without embedded timecode gracefully (default to 00:00:00:00 start).

### Implementation Notes (for future reference)

**New Files Created:**
- `Timecoder/Models/VideoMetadata.swift` — Video metadata value type with formatted display properties
- `Timecoder/Services/VideoLoader.swift` — AVFoundation-based async video loader service (actor)
- `Timecoder/App/AppState.swift` — Global app state managing mode and video loading
- `Timecoder/Views/Metadata/MetadataPanel.swift` — Metadata display panel with Grid layout
- `Timecoder/Views/Main/VideoInspectorView.swift` — Combined video player + calculator layout

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
- `VideoLoader` is an actor for thread-safe async video loading
- `AppState` is a `@MainActor` class managing mode switching and video state
- Drag-and-drop uses `UniformTypeIdentifiers` for file type detection
- Files are copied to temp directory before loading (required for sandboxed access)
- Frame rate auto-syncs to calculator via `onChange` when video loads

**Metadata Extraction:**
- Codec names extracted from `CMFormatDescription` FourCC codes
- Color space from format description extensions
- Audio channels counted from all audio tracks
- Bitrate from `estimatedDataRate` on video track

**Video Player:**
- Uses `AVKit.VideoPlayer` for basic playback (full controls in Sprint 4)
- Player created via `VideoLoader.createPlayer(for:)`
- Close button overlay returns to calculator mode

**Build Commands:**
```bash
# Build via Xcode
xcodebuild -project Timecoder.xcodeproj -scheme Timecoder build

# Run tests via SPM
swift test
```

---

## Sprint 4: Video Player & Transport

### Goal
Full video playback with professional transport controls and bidirectional calculator sync.

### Deliverables

- [x] `VideoPlayerViewModel` managing AVPlayer state
- [x] `VideoPlayerView` wrapping AVKit player
- [x] `TransportControls` — play/pause, JKL shuttle
- [x] `TimelineView` — scrubber/timeline with playhead
- [x] Frame-accurate seeking (zero tolerance)
- [x] Periodic timecode update to calculator display
- [x] Frame stepping (←/→ arrow keys)
- [x] Shuttle speed indicator (1×, 2×, 4×, etc.)
- [x] Bidirectional calculator ↔ player sync

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Space bar toggles play/pause
- [x] J = reverse (stacks: 1×, 2×, 4×)
- [x] K = stop
- [x] L = forward (stacks: 1×, 2×, 4×)
- [ ] K+J or K+L = slow motion (optional, nice-to-have — deferred)
- [x] Arrow keys step exactly one frame
- [x] Timeline scrubbing is frame-accurate
- [x] Calculator display updates in real-time during playback
- [x] Responsive layout adapts to window resize
- [x] **Scrubbing/playback updates calculator timecode display**
- [x] **Typing timecode + Enter seeks playhead to that position**

### Notes

Use `addPeriodicTimeObserver` with interval of `CMTime(value: 1, timescale: frameRate)` for smooth updates. Test with various codecs (ProRes, H.264, HEVC).

**Bidirectional Sync Implementation:**
- Player → Calculator: Use periodic time observer to update `CalculatorViewModel.currentTimecode` during playback/scrubbing
- Calculator → Player: On Enter key (when in video mode), convert displayed timecode to CMTime and seek player
- For videos without embedded TC, use elapsed time from 00:00:00:00
- For videos with embedded TC, offset by start timecode when seeking

### Implementation Notes (for future reference)

**New Files Created:**
- `Timecoder/ViewModels/VideoPlayerViewModel.swift` — Manages AVPlayer state, shuttle control, time observer, frame stepping
- `Timecoder/Views/VideoPlayer/TransportControls.swift` — Play/pause, JKL shuttle buttons, speed indicator
- `Timecoder/Views/VideoPlayer/TimelineView.swift` — Scrubber, playhead, click-to-seek

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
- `VideoPlayerViewModel` is `@MainActor` isolated for thread-safe UI updates
- `ShuttleState` enum tracks -4× to +4× playback speeds
- Periodic time observer updates at frame-rate interval for smooth display
- Bidirectional sync: player updates calculator via callback, calculator seeks player via Enter key

**Shuttle Implementation:**
- J key increases reverse speed: stopped→-1×→-2×→-4×
- L key increases forward speed: stopped→1×→2×→4×
- K key stops playback
- Visual indicator shows current shuttle speed with colored bars

**Keyboard Handling:**
- Uses `NSViewRepresentable` with custom `NSView.keyDown()` for macOS 13.0 compatibility
- Handles Space (play/pause), J/K/L (shuttle), arrows (frame step), Enter (seek)
- Separate keyboard handler for video mode (`VideoKeyboardHandler`) to avoid conflicts with calculator

**Build Commands:**
```bash
# Build via Xcode
xcodebuild -project Timecoder.xcodeproj -scheme Timecoder build

# Run tests via SPM
swift test
```

### Bug Fixes Applied

**Window Sizing:**
- Calculator mode: Window resizes to 320×520 on launch and when closing video
- Video mode: Window sizes naturally to fit video content
- Video display explicitly sized based on video dimensions (max height 700px, width calculated from aspect ratio) to eliminate black bars

**AVKit Controls:**
- Created `CustomVideoPlayerView` using `AVPlayerView` with `controlsStyle = .none` to hide default AVKit controls
- Prevents duplicate playhead UI on hover

**Transport Controls:**
- Replaced J/K/L text labels with SF Symbols (`backward.fill`, `play.fill`/`pause.fill`, `forward.fill`)
- Fixed play button to call `togglePlayPause()` instead of `handleK()`

**Keyboard Handling:**
- Fixed keyboard handler to properly capture focus in video mode
- Added number key routing (0-9) to calculator when in video inspector
- Enter key commits calculator entry and seeks player to that timecode

**Layout:**
- Video player area sized to exact video dimensions using metadata
- Right panel fixed at 320px width
- Timeline and transport controls always visible below video

---

## Sprint 5: In/Out Points

### Goal
Mark in/out points on video and calculate durations.

### Deliverables

- [x] In/Out point state in `VideoPlayerViewModel`
- [x] `InOutOverlay` visual indicators on timeline
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts: I (in), O (out), ⌥X (clear)
- [x] Navigation: ⇧I (go to in), ⇧O (go to out)
- [x] Duration display (out minus in)
- [x] Visual feedback when points are set
- [x] In/Out timecode display in UI

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] I key sets in point at current playhead
- [x] O key sets out point at current playhead
- [x] Duration auto-calculates and displays
- [x] ⇧I jumps to in point
- [x] ⇧O jumps to out point
- [x] ⌥X clears both points
- [x] In/Out points visible on timeline as markers/overlay
- [x] Setting out before in shows warning or swaps automatically

### Notes

Store in/out as frame numbers, not CMTime, to avoid floating point drift. Display in current frame rate format.

### Implementation Notes (for future reference)

**VideoPlayerViewModel Additions:**
- `inPointFrames: Int?` and `outPointFrames: Int?` — Frame-based storage (nil when not set)
- Computed properties: `inPointTimecode`, `outPointTimecode`, `inOutDuration`, `inPointProgress`, `outPointProgress`
- Methods: `setInPoint()`, `setOutPoint()`, `clearInOutPoints()`, `seekToInPoint()`, `seekToOutPoint()`
- Auto-swap logic: If setting out before in (or vice versa), automatically swap to maintain correct order
- Points cleared in `reset()` when video changes

**TimelineView Enhancements:**
- Yellow highlighted range between In and Out points
- `InOutMarker` component with directional arrow shapes (|> for In, <| for Out)
- Markers positioned using computed progress values from ViewModel

**InOutPanel UI:**
- Displays In, Out, and Duration timecodes
- Clear button appears when any point is set
- Go-to buttons for quick navigation
- Keyboard hints for discoverability

**Keyboard Handling:**
- Extended `VideoKeyboardCaptureView.handleKeyEvent()` in VideoInspectorView
- Modifier key detection: `event.modifierFlags.contains(.shift)` for ⇧I/⇧O
- Option key detection: `event.modifierFlags.contains(.option)` for ⌥X

**Key Files Modified:**
- `VideoPlayerViewModel.swift` — State and methods for In/Out points
- `TimelineView.swift` — Visual overlay and InOutMarker component
- `VideoInspectorView.swift` — Keyboard handling, InOutPanel UI component

**Post-Implementation UI Refinements:**
- Reordered right panel: Calculator at top (primary tool), In/Out in middle, Metadata at bottom (static reference)
- Replaced fixed 700px video height cap with responsive GeometryReader-based sizing
- Video now fills available space while maintaining aspect ratio
- Portrait videos (e.g., 1080×1920) display at full height instead of being artificially constrained

---

## Sprint 6: Marker System

### Goal
Create, edit, and manage markers with colors and notes.

### Deliverables

- [x] `Marker` model (id, timecode, color, note, created timestamp)
- [x] `MarkerListViewModel` for marker management
- [x] `MarkerEditorPopover` — compact editor overlay on video
- [x] Add marker: M key at current playhead
- [x] Edit marker: M key on existing marker OR click marker on timeline
- [x] Delete marker: Delete key or trash button in editor
- [x] Color picker with 8 predefined colors
- [x] Markers visible on timeline

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] M key creates marker at playhead with default color (blue)
- [x] M key on existing marker position opens editor
- [x] Can change marker color from 8 options
- [x] Clicking marker on timeline opens editor
- [x] Delete removes marker
- [x] Markers persist during session (cleared when video closes)
- [x] Timeline shows marker indicators at correct positions

### Notes

Consider keyboard shortcuts for quick color assignment (1-8 keys after M?). Marker colors should match the NLE-compatible palette from PRD.

### Implementation Notes (for future reference)

**Design Decision:** Markers display only on timeline (no sidebar list). Editor appears as popover overlay centered on video, matching NLE behavior. This keeps the UI compact and prevents layout overflow on smaller screens.

**New Files Created:**
- `Timecoder/Models/Marker.swift` — Marker struct + MarkerColor enum with 8 NLE-compatible colors (exact hex values from PRD)
- `Timecoder/ViewModels/MarkerListViewModel.swift` — CRUD operations, selection, editor state
- `Timecoder/Views/Markers/TimelineMarkerView.swift` — Triangle + line indicator for timeline
- `Timecoder/Views/Markers/MarkerEditorPopover.swift` — Compact overlay editor (timecode, color picker, note field, delete/done)

**Modified Files:**
- `TimelineView.swift` — Added markers array parameter, renders TimelineMarkerView for each, added onMarkerTapped callback
- `VideoInspectorView.swift` — Integrated markerVM, marker popover overlay, M key and Delete key handlers, keyboard focus management

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- M — Add marker at playhead (opens editor); if marker exists at position, opens editor for it
- Delete — Remove selected marker
- Click marker on timeline — Open editor

**Keyboard Focus Handling:**
The VideoKeyboardCaptureView aggressively captures keyboard focus for JKL/arrow/space controls. When marker editor opens, it releases focus to allow text input. Uses NotificationCenter to reclaim focus when editor closes.

**Key Files:**
- `Timecoder/Models/Marker.swift` — MarkerColor enum with displayColor (SwiftUI), avidColorName, resolveColorName
- `Timecoder/ViewModels/MarkerListViewModel.swift` — @MainActor, @Published markers array, CRUD methods
- `Timecoder/Views/Markers/MarkerEditorPopover.swift` — Auto-saves color changes, commits note on Done/Enter

**Build Commands:**
```bash
xcodebuild -project Timecoder.xcodeproj -scheme Timecoder build
swift test
```

## Sprint 7: Marker Export

### Goal
Export markers in formats compatible with Resolve, Avid, and generic CSV.

### Deliverables

- [x] `MarkerExporter` service with format-specific methods
- [x] EDL export for DaVinci Resolve
- [x] Tab-delimited text export for Avid Media Composer
- [x] CSV export for spreadsheets/other NLEs
- [x] Export dialog with format selection
- [x] File save panel integration
- [x] ⌘E keyboard shortcut for export
- [x] Include source filename in export metadata

### EDL Format (Resolve)
```
TITLE: [Filename]
FCM: NON-DROP FRAME

001  001      V     C        [TC_IN] [TC_OUT] [TC_IN] [TC_OUT]
* FROM CLIP NAME: [Filename]
* COMMENT: [Marker Note]
```

### Avid Format
```
Timecoder	[Timecode]	V1	[color]	[Note]
```

### CSV Format
```csv
Timecode In,Timecode Out,Color,Name,Duration,Source
01:00:00:00,,Red,Marker note,,filename.mov
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- Export to Downloads folder (sandbox compliant)
- EDL imports into Resolve as timeline markers
- Text file imports into Avid via Marker Tool
- CSV opens correctly in Excel/Numbers/Sheets
- All markers included with correct timecodes
- Drop frame notation used when applicable
- ⌘E opens export dialog

### Notes

Test actual import in Resolve and Avid. Format quirks often only surface during real-world import.

### Implementation Notes (for future reference)

**New Files Created:**
- `Timecoder/Services/MarkerExporter.swift` — Actor-based export service with format generators
- `Timecoder/Views/Export/ExportDialogView.swift` — SwiftUI sheet with format picker + NSSavePanel

**Key Architecture Decisions:**
- `MarkerExporter` is an actor for thread-safe async file operations
- Each export format has a dedicated private generator method (generateEDL, generateAvidText, generateCSV)
- Uses NSSavePanel directly (not SwiftUI fileExporter) for better sandbox compatibility
- Drop frame notation handled automatically by Timecode.formatted()

**Export Format Details:**
- **EDL:** Includes TITLE, FCM header (DROP/NON-DROP FRAME), event entries with MARKER COLOR comments
- **Avid:** Tab-delimited with fallback colors (orange→yellow, purple→blue) for unsupported Avid colors
- **CSV:** Standard columns with proper escaping for commas/quotes in notes

**Modified Files:**
- `VideoInspectorView.swift` — Added export dialog sheet, ⌘E keyboard handler, NotificationCenter listener
- `TimecoderApp.swift` — Added File > Export Markers... menu item
- `Marker.swift` — Added `avidExportColorName` computed property for fallback colors

**Build Commands:**
```bash
xcodebuild -project Timecoder.xcodeproj -scheme Timecoder build
swift test
```

**Known Issue (to fix in next session):**
- Export button in ExportDialogView does not trigger the save panel
- Clicking "Export..." button has no effect
- Possible causes: SwiftUI sheet button action not firing, Task not executing, or NSSavePanel issue
- Debug approach: Add print statements to `exportMarkers()` to trace execution flow
- File to investigate: `Timecoder/Views/Export/ExportDialogView.swift`

---

## Sprint 8: Polish & Infrastructure

### Goal
Fix critical bugs, add visual polish, and implement standard macOS app infrastructure.

### Known Issues to Address

**Export Button Bug (from Sprint 7):**
- Export button in ExportDialogView does not trigger the save panel
- Root cause: `NSSavePanel.runModal()` called from within SwiftUI sheet context
- Fix: Dismiss sheet first, then show save panel after brief delay

**Calculator Entry Validation (from Sprint 2 testing):**
- Current behavior: Digits are formatted as entered (shifting left like a calculator), validation only occurs on operation/equals
- Issue: User can see invalid timecode values during entry (e.g., `00:06:66:66` where seconds=66, frames=66)
- Recommended fix: Show invalid portions in red/different color during entry to indicate "draft" input that will fail validation
- The entry-then-validate approach is correct (user might type valid digits that temporarily form invalid intermediate values), but visual feedback should be clearer
- Consider: Pulsing border, different text color for invalid components, or subtle "invalid" indicator

**Typography:**
- Switch from SF Mono to Space Mono for timecode display
- Space Mono: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono
- Bundle font with app (OFL license allows this)
- Use Space Mono for all numeric/timecode display, SF Pro for UI text

### Deliverables

- [x] Fix export button bug (NSSavePanel from sheet context)
- [x] Bundle and use Space Mono typeface for timecode display
- [x] Calculator entry validation visual feedback
- [x] User preferences system (default frame rate, marker color)
- [x] Dark mode refinement (colors, contrast, vibrancy)
- [x] Light mode support and testing
- [x] Empty states (no video loaded, no markers)
- [x] Menu bar integration (File, Edit, View, Window, Help)
- [x] Preferences window
- [x] About window (via standard macOS About menu)
- [x] Keyboard shortcut discoverability (menu items, tooltips)
- [x] Window restoration (remember size/position)

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Export button works correctly
- [x] App feels native and professional in both dark and light mode
- [x] All features accessible via keyboard
- [x] Menu bar shows all available actions with keyboard shortcuts
- [x] Preferences persist across app launches
- [x] App launches in < 1 second

### Notes

Focus on making the app feel like a polished, native macOS application before moving to App Store submission.

### Implementation Notes (for future reference)

**Export Button Bug Fix:**
- Changed `ExportDialogView.exportMarkers()` to dismiss sheet first, then show NSSavePanel after 0.1s delay
- `NSSavePanel.runModal()` doesn't work properly when called from within a SwiftUI sheet context

**Space Mono Font:**
- Downloaded from GitHub (googlefonts/spacemono) to `Timecoder/Resources/Fonts/`
- Font extension added to `AppState.swift` with fallback to system monospace
- Updated all timecode displays: TimecodeDisplayView, VideoInspectorView (In/Out panel), MarkerEditorSheet, MarkerRowView, TimelineView, FrameRatePicker, TransportControls
- **User Action Required:** Add font files to Xcode project with target membership and add `ATSApplicationFontsPath` to Info.plist

**Calculator Entry Validation:**
- Added `TimecodeComponent` enum and `invalidComponents` computed property to `CalculatorViewModel`
- `TimecodeDisplayView` now shows invalid components (minutes >= 60, seconds >= 60, frames >= frame rate) in orange
- Border color changes to orange when any component is invalid

**User Preferences System:**
- Created `UserPreferences` singleton class in `AppState.swift`
- Stores: default frame rate, default marker color, dark/light mode preference, window restoration preference
- Uses JSON encoding for FrameRate storage in UserDefaults

**Preferences Window:**
- Added `PreferencesView` to `TimecoderApp.swift`
- Settings: Default Frame Rate picker, Default Marker Color picker with color preview, Theme selector (System/Light/Dark), Window restoration toggle
- Uses SwiftUI Form with grouped style

**Menu Bar & Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- Help menu with "Timecoder Help" and "Keyboard Shortcuts" (Cmd+Shift+?)
- Keyboard shortcuts window shows all available shortcuts via NSAlert
- Export Markers menu item (Cmd+E)

**Dark/Light Mode:**
- Removed hardcoded `.preferredColorScheme(.dark)`
- Now respects user preference via `UserPreferences.preferDarkMode`
- Options: System (nil), Light (false), Dark (true)

**Empty States:**
- Timeline shows "Press M to add marker" hint when no markers exist

**Window Restoration:**
- `NSQuitAlwaysKeepsWindows` now respects `UserPreferences.rememberWindowPosition`

**Xcode Project Setup for Fonts:**
- Added file references for SpaceMono-Regular.ttf and SpaceMono-Bold.ttf to project.pbxproj
- Created Resources and Fonts groups in project structure
- Added fonts to PBXResourcesBuildPhase for copying to app bundle
- Created `Timecoder/Info.plist` with `ATSApplicationFontsPath = "."` (fonts in bundle root)
- Set `INFOPLIST_FILE = Timecoder/Info.plist` in both Debug and Release build settings

**Crash Bug Fix (Text Selection):**
- Crash occurred when user attempted to select text in calculator timecode display
- Root cause: SwiftUI's `.textSelection(.enabled)` modifier crashes on concatenated Text views (using `+` operator)
- The `coloredTimecodeText` computed property concatenates multiple Text views with different foreground colors
- Fix: Only enable text selection when `invalidComponents.isEmpty`, otherwise omit the modifier
- This allows copy/paste in normal mode while avoiding the crash during validation display

**Key Files Modified:**
- `Timecoder/Views/Export/ExportDialogView.swift` - Export bug fix
- `Timecoder/App/AppState.swift` - UserPreferences, Font extension
- `Timecoder/App/TimecoderApp.swift` - PreferencesView, Settings scene, menus, @ObservedObject for preferences
- `Timecoder/ViewModels/CalculatorViewModel.swift` - Entry validation, TimecodeComponent enum
- `Timecoder/Views/Calculator/TimecodeDisplayView.swift` - Validation UI, Space Mono, text selection crash fix
- `Timecoder/Views/VideoPlayer/TimelineView.swift` - Empty state hint, Space Mono
- `Timecoder.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Font file references, build phase, Info.plist config
- `Timecoder/Info.plist` - NEW: ATSApplicationFontsPath for font loading

**New Files Created:**
- `Timecoder/Resources/Fonts/SpaceMono-Regular.ttf`
- `Timecoder/Resources/Fonts/SpaceMono-Bold.ttf`
- `Timecoder/Resources/Fonts/OFL.txt` - Open Font License
- `Timecoder/Info.plist` - App Info.plist with font path

## Sprint 9: Quality & App Store Submission

### Goal
Final UI polish, quality assurance, accessibility audit, and App Store submission preparation.

---

### Phase 1: Final UI Polish

Complete these UI refinements before taking App Store screenshots.

#### Calculator Improvements

- [x] **Combine F→TC/TC→F buttons** — Replace two separate buttons with single F↔TC toggle button
  - Single button cycles between modes or shows current conversion direction
  - Simplifies keypad layout and reduces cognitive load

- [x] **Add grid lines to keypad** — Visual grid between calculator number buttons
  - Subtle lines to suggest button boundaries
  - Improves visual hierarchy and touch target clarity

#### In/Out Panel Cleanup

- [x] **Remove "In/Out" header** — Section is self-explanatory, header wastes space
- [x] **Remove legend below In/Out** — Unnecessary UI chrome
- [x] **Make In/Out values selectable** — Enable text selection on In, Out, and Duration timecodes
  - Users need to copy these values to other applications
  - Use `.textSelection(.enabled)` modifier

### Implementation Notes — Phase 1 (for future reference)

**F↔TC Toggle Button:**
- Created `FrameTimecodeToggleButton` component in `KeypadView.swift`
- Single button shows "F ⟷ TC" with visual feedback indicating current mode
- Tapping toggles between `framesToTimecode` and `timecodeToFrames` operations
- Uses accent color highlighting on the active direction indicator

**Keypad Grid Lines:**
- Created `NumberPadGrid` component wrapping the number buttons
- Uses SwiftUI `Canvas` to draw subtle grid lines between button rows/columns
- Grid lines color: `Color.primary.opacity(0.1)` for subtle appearance
- Lines drawn at midpoint of spacing between buttons

**In/Out Panel Cleanup:**
- Removed "In/Out" header text
- Removed keyboard hints legend (I = In, O = Out, ⌥X = Clear)
- Added `.textSelection(.enabled)` to In, Out, and Duration timecode Text views
- Moved Clear button to bottom-right of panel with icon

**Marker Navigation:**
- Added `nextMarker(after:)` and `previousMarker(before:)` methods to `MarkerListViewModel`
- Added navigation buttons to `TransportControls` with bookmark icons and chevron arrows
- Buttons disabled when no marker exists in that direction
- Keyboard shortcuts: ↑ (key code 126) for previous, ↓ (key code 125) for next
- Updated `VideoKeyboardHandler` and `VideoKeyboardCaptureView` with navigation callbacks

**Key Files Modified:**
- `Timecoder/Views/Calculator/KeypadView.swift` — F↔TC toggle, NumberPadGrid with grid lines
- `Timecoder/Views/Main/VideoInspectorView.swift` — InOutPanel cleanup, marker navigation handlers
- `Timecoder/Views/VideoPlayer/TransportControls.swift` — Marker navigation buttons
- `Timecoder/ViewModels/MarkerListViewModel.swift` — Navigation methods

**Session 2 Implementation (2025-12-31):**

**Custom Color Scheme:**
- Added `Color.timecoderTeal` (#65DEF1), `Color.timecoderOrange` (#F96900), `Color.timecoderButtonBackground` extensions to `AppState.swift`
- Updated all button styles in `KeypadView.swift` to use theme colors:
  - Primary buttons: timecoderTeal
  - Accent buttons: timecoderTeal
  - Destructive buttons: timecoderOrange
  - Number/secondary buttons: timecoderButtonBackground
- Updated accent colors across: `TimelineView.swift`, `TransportControls.swift`, `TimecodeDisplayView.swift`, `MarkerRowView.swift`

**Division Button:**
- Added `divide` case to `CalculatorOperation` enum in `CalculatorViewModel.swift`
- Implemented division execution logic (divides timecode frames by scalar)
- Added ÷ button to `KeypadView.swift` operators column
- Renamed `MultiplierInput` to `ScalarInput` with configurable label (shows "Divisor" or "Multiplier")
- Added "/" keyboard shortcut for division

**Header Removal:**
- Removed "Timecode Calculator" header text from `CalculatorView.swift`

**Window Resizing (Partial):**
- Simplified window resizing logic in `ContentView.swift`
- Window resizes to 320×520 when returning to calculator mode
- Manual window sizing removed for video mode (SwiftUI handles it)
- 9:16 videos display correctly; 16:9 videos do not (see Sprint 10)

---

## Sprint 10: Responsive Video Layout (Dedicated Fix)

### Goal
Fix the video inspector layout so both 16:9 and 9:16 videos display correctly without unwanted letterboxing or pillarboxing within the UI frame.

### Problem Statement

The current implementation correctly displays 9:16 (portrait) videos but fails for 16:9 (landscape) videos. Landscape videos appear pillarboxed within an incorrect frame size, with excessive black bars.

The root issue is that SwiftUI's layout system and the interaction between `aspectRatio`, `frame` modifiers, and window sizing don't behave predictably when trying to create a responsive layout that adapts to arbitrary video aspect ratios.

---

### Failed Approaches (Documented for Reference)

#### Attempt 1: aspectRatio with contentMode .fit
```swift
CustomVideoPlayerView(player: player)
    .aspectRatio(videoAspectRatio, contentMode: .fit)
```
**Result:** Letterboxing above video player. The container doesn't shrink to match the fitted content.

#### Attempt 2: GeometryReader with Explicit Frame
```swift
GeometryReader { geo in
    CustomVideoPlayerView(player: player)
        .frame(width: calculatedWidth, height: calculatedHeight)
}
```
**Result:** UI clipping issues. GeometryReader's proposed size doesn't account for other UI elements, causing overflow.

#### Attempt 3: Increased controlsHeight Constant
Increased timeline/transport area height from 85 to 110 to account for controls.
**Result:** Still incorrect spacing. The fundamental layout calculation was wrong.

#### Attempt 4: fixedSize Modifier
```swift
HStack(alignment: .top, spacing: 0) { ... }
    .fixedSize(horizontal: false, vertical: true)
```
**Result:** Inconsistent results. 16:9 initial load had too much space; third load had cropped UI.

#### Attempt 5: Calculated Video Dimensions
Added computed properties to calculate video width/height based on aspect ratio and available space.
```swift
private var calculatedVideoWidth: CGFloat { ... }
private var calculatedVideoHeight: CGFloat { ... }
```
**Result:** Still incorrect spacing. The calculations didn't account for SwiftUI's layout pass correctly.

#### Attempt 6: rightPanelMinHeight with max()
Added minimum height constraint to ensure right panel was at least as tall as video area.
```swift
.frame(width: 320, minHeight: rightPanelMinHeight)
```
**Result:** Both 16:9 versions displayed incorrectly.

#### Attempt 7: Remove Manual Window Sizing for Video Mode
Removed all manual `NSWindow.setFrame()` calls for video mode, letting SwiftUI handle window sizing via `.windowResizability(.contentSize)`.
```swift
.onChange(of: appState.mode) { newMode in
    if newMode == .calculator {
        resizeWindowForCalculator()
    }
    // No manual sizing for video mode
}
```
**Result:** 9:16 works correctly. 16:9 fails (pillarboxed in wrong frame).

---

### Current State of Code

**VideoInspectorView.swift:**
```swift
var body: some View {
    HStack(alignment: .top, spacing: 0) {
        videoPlayerArea
            .frame(minWidth: 500, idealWidth: 700, maxWidth: 900)
        Divider()
        rightPanel
            .frame(width: 320)
    }
    .fixedSize(horizontal: false, vertical: true)
}

private var videoPlayerArea: some View {
    VStack(spacing: 0) {
        ZStack {
            if let player = appState.player {
                CustomVideoPlayerView(player: player)
                    .aspectRatio(videoAspectRatio, contentMode: .fit)
            } else {
                Color.black
                    .aspectRatio(16.0/9.0, contentMode: .fit)
            }
        }
        // Timeline and transport controls below
    }
}
```

**ContentView.swift:**
- Only resizes window for calculator mode (320×520)
- Video mode relies on SwiftUI's natural sizing

---

### Proposed Solution: Two-Mode Layout

**Design Principle:** Simplify by supporting only two layout modes:
1. **Landscape Mode (16:9)** — For videos with aspect ratio ≥ 1.0
2. **Portrait Mode (9:16)** — For videos with aspect ratio < 1.0

Videos with non-standard aspect ratios (e.g., 4:3, 2.35:1, 1:1) will be letterboxed or pillarboxed within the appropriate mode's frame.

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Detect Video Orientation**
   - Check `videoAspectRatio >= 1.0` for landscape, `< 1.0` for portrait
   - Store as enum: `enum VideoOrientation { case landscape, portrait }`

2. **Fixed Frame Sizes**
   - Landscape mode: Video area 700×394 (16:9), window ~1020×520
   - Portrait mode: Video area 394×700 (9:16), window ~714×826
   - Right panel: Always 320 width

3. **Window Sizing on Video Load**
   - Calculate target window size based on detected orientation
   - Use `NSWindow.setFrame()` with animation
   - Center expansion from current position (don't go off-screen)

4. **Video Display Within Frame**
   - Use `aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)` within the fixed frame
   - Non-standard ratios naturally letterbox/pillarbox within the mode's frame
   - Example: 4:3 video in landscape mode shows with pillarboxing
   - Example: 1:1 video in portrait mode shows with letterboxing top/bottom

5. **Resize on New Video**
   - When dropping a new video, detect its orientation
   - If orientation changes (landscape→portrait or vice versa), animate window resize
   - If same orientation, no resize needed

#### Key Code Changes

**AppState.swift:**
```swift
enum VideoOrientation {
    case landscape  // aspect ratio >= 1.0
    case portrait   // aspect ratio < 1.0

    static func from(aspectRatio: CGFloat) -> VideoOrientation {
        aspectRatio >= 1.0 ? .landscape : .portrait
    }
}
```

**VideoInspectorView.swift:**
```swift
private var videoOrientation: VideoOrientation {
    VideoOrientation.from(aspectRatio: videoAspectRatio)
}

private var videoFrameSize: CGSize {
    switch videoOrientation {
    case .landscape:
        return CGSize(width: 700, height: 394)  // 16:9
    case .portrait:
        return CGSize(width: 394, height: 700)  // 9:16
    }
}

private var videoPlayerArea: some View {
    VStack(spacing: 0) {
        ZStack {
            Color.black  // Background for letterboxing
            if let player = appState.player {
                CustomVideoPlayerView(player: player)
                    .aspectRatio(videoAspectRatio, contentMode: .fit)
            }
        }
        .frame(width: videoFrameSize.width, height: videoFrameSize.height)
        // Timeline and controls below
    }
}
```

**ContentView.swift:**
```swift
private func resizeWindowForVideo(orientation: VideoOrientation) {
    DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.05) {
        guard let window = NSApplication.shared.keyWindow else { return }

        let targetSize: NSSize
        switch orientation {
        case .landscape:
            targetSize = NSSize(width: 1020, height: 520)
        case .portrait:
            targetSize = NSSize(width: 714, height: 826)
        }

        // Calculate new frame keeping window on screen
        let screenFrame = window.screen?.visibleFrame ?? NSScreen.main?.visibleFrame ?? .zero
        var newFrame = window.frame
        newFrame.size = targetSize

        // Adjust origin to keep on screen
        if newFrame.maxX > screenFrame.maxX {
            newFrame.origin.x = screenFrame.maxX - targetSize.width
        }
        if newFrame.origin.y < screenFrame.origin.y {
            newFrame.origin.y = screenFrame.origin.y
        }

        window.setFrame(newFrame, display: true, animate: true)
    }
}
```

---

### Implementation Notes (for future reference)

**VideoOrientation Enum (AppState.swift):**
- Added `VideoOrientation` enum with `.landscape` and `.portrait` cases
- `from(aspectRatio:)` factory method: returns `.landscape` for ratio >= 1.0, `.portrait` otherwise
- `controlsHeight` constant: 110px for timeline and transport controls
- `videoFrameSize` computed property: returns fixed CGSize for each orientation
  - Landscape: 960×540 (16:9 qHD proportions)
  - Portrait: 394×700 (9:16 proportions)
- `videoAreaHeight` computed property: videoFrameSize.height + controlsHeight
- `windowSize` computed property: calculated from video area height + title bar
  - Landscape: 1296×678
  - Portrait: 730×838

**VideoInspectorView.swift Changes:**
- Added `videoOrientation` and `videoFrameSize` computed properties
- Added `contentHeight` computed property using `videoOrientation.videoAreaHeight`
- Video container uses fixed `.frame(width:height:)` with `videoFrameSize`
- Right panel wrapped in ScrollView with explicit height matching video area
- Both panels use explicit height constraints for proper alignment
- `VideoKeyboardCaptureView.resignFirstResponder()` now checks for NSTextView/NSText before reclaiming focus (allows text selection)

**ContentView.swift Changes:**
- Added `resizeWindowForVideo(orientation:)` method
- Window resizes based on detected video orientation when metadata loads
- Screen bounds checking ensures window stays on screen
- Animated transition between sizes using `setFrame(animate: true)`

**CalculatorView.swift Changes:**
- Reduced VStack spacing from 16 to 4
- Reduced top padding from 12 to 4
- Tighter layout between fps picker and timecode display

**KeypadView.swift Changes:**
- Reorganized operator buttons to align with number pad rows (4 operators for 4 rows)
- Moved "=" button to full-width row at bottom with orange (destructive) style
- Operators column now properly aligned: +, −, ×, ÷

**TimecodeDisplayView.swift Changes:**
- Added `isFrameDisplay` and `frameNumber` computed properties
- Frame mode display separates number from "f" suffix
- Number is selectable, "f" suffix is dimmed and not selectable
- Secondary frame count display also separates number from "frames" label

**Key Files Modified:**
- `Timecoder/App/AppState.swift` — VideoOrientation enum with updated dimensions
- `Timecoder/Views/Main/VideoInspectorView.swift` — Fixed frame sizing, ScrollView for right panel, text selection fix
- `Timecoder/Views/Main/ContentView.swift` — Orientation-based window sizing
- `Timecoder/Views/Calculator/CalculatorView.swift` — Reduced spacing
- `Timecoder/Views/Calculator/KeypadView.swift` — Reorganized button layout
- `Timecoder/Views/Calculator/TimecodeDisplayView.swift` — Frame display text selection

---

### Notes

This sprint is a focused fix for a specific layout issue. The two-mode approach trades flexibility for reliability — we accept that some videos will have minor letterboxing/pillarboxing in exchange for a predictable, working layout.

The key insight from failed attempts: trying to make the UI "perfectly responsive" to arbitrary aspect ratios within SwiftUI's constraint-based layout system leads to edge cases. Fixed frames with content fitting inside them is more predictable.

- [x] Replace custom button styles with `.buttonStyle(.glass)` and `.buttonStyle(.glassProminent)`
- [x] Add `.glassEffect()` modifier to custom views (timecode display, In/Out panel)
- [x] Circular buttons for keypad with proper spacing
- [x] Capsule-shaped equals button spanning full keypad width
- [x] Orange operator buttons using `timecoderOrange`
- [x] Teal equals button using `timecoderTeal`
- [x] Glass styling for video transport controls
- [x] Proper bottom padding in video inspector mode

### Key API Changes

**Button Styles:**
```swift
.buttonStyle(.glass)           // Standard glass button
.buttonStyle(.glassProminent)  // Prominent/accent glass button
```

**Glass Effect:**
```swift
.glassEffect(in: .rect(cornerRadius: 12))  // Rounded rectangle
.glassEffect(in: .capsule)                  // Capsule shape
.glassEffect(in: .circle)                   // Circle shape
```

**Tinting Glass:**
```swift
.tint(.timecoderOrange)  // Custom tint color
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Number buttons use `.buttonStyle(.glass)` with `.clipShape(Circle())`
- [x] Operator buttons use `.buttonStyle(.glassProminent)` with `.tint(.timecoderOrange)`
- [x] Equals button uses `.buttonStyle(.glassProminent)` with `.tint(.timecoderTeal)`
- [x] Timecode display has `.glassEffect(in: .rect(cornerRadius: 12))`
- [x] In/Out panel has `.glassEffect(in: .rect(cornerRadius: 12))`
- [x] Calculator window sized to 300×540
- [x] Video inspector has proper bottom padding (12pt)
- [x] All keyboard shortcuts continue to work
